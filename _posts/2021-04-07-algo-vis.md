I recently comleted [this **Algorithms Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?ranMID=40328&ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-iw85ccUCuirYN6zfrgqgAw&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-iw85ccUCuirYN6zfrgqgAw&utm_content=10&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=TnL5HPStwNw) on Coursera, and I decided it would be cool to put some of my newly acquired skills to the test, while also learning about web development, so I created [Algorithm Visualiser](https://algovis.andcov.dev). It is an interactive site where you can, as the name implies, see how some algorithms work.

Unfortunately, many algorithms do not lend themselves to being displayed in preatty, visual way, so I don't think this is a great way to rigorously learn about the vast world of algorithm design. Nevertheless, it can be a good way to start learning about algorithms in a more intuitive way than pseudocode.

I used `Vue.js` for the frontend (although I don't think it would be very hard to rewrite it in Vanilla JS) and I'm hosting the app on GitHub Pages. Since this is my first time using Vue, I would not recommend you use my code as any sort of example.
