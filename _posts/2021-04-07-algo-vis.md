After finishing [this algorithms course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?ranMID=40328&ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-iw85ccUCuirYN6zfrgqgAw&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-iw85ccUCuirYN6zfrgqgAw&utm_content=10&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=TnL5HPStwNw), I decided it would be cool to put some of my newly acquired skills to the test, while also learning about web development, so I created [Algorithm Visualiser](https://algovis.andcov.dev). It is an interactive site where you can, as the name implies, see how some algorithms work.

The interface is made up of a board (this is where the action happens) and some options (on the left). To run an algorithm, just hover over the `Algorithms` tab and pick one. The blue cells indicate what the algorithm is checking at the moment. If it finds a path, it will highlight it in yellow.

After a while, you might figure out that running BFS ten times on the same, empty board yields the same path, and that's kinda boring... So let's modify the board!

A cell can have six values:
* the green, start cell (the algorithm starts here)
* the red, destination cell (the algorithm tries to reach this cell)
* empty (adds 1 to a path cost)
* wall (a path cannot go through a wall)
* light (algorithms that take weights into consideration[^1] will prefer these cells to empty or heavy ones; they add 0.25 to a path cost)
* heavy (algorithms that take weights into consideration[^2] will try light or empty cells before checking these; they add 4 to a path cost)

By default, all the cells are empty. To add walls, click a cell or drag over the board. Cells should turn darker. To add light cells, click a cell while pressing `L`, and a feather icon should appear. Similarly for heavy ones, but you should press `H`. The start and destination cell can be changed using the buttons on the left.

Now you can play around with different configurations. You may also want to slow down the `Solving Speed` so you can more easily see each algorithm's strategy for checking cells.

If, after trying out different algorithms, you want to compare their performance, look no further than the `Stats` tab. Here, you can see how many of the reachable cells the algorithm visited (obviously, smaller means better), as well as the cost of the path it found and the number of operations each algorithm required. Note that the number of operations is not really a rigorous quantity, but it's a good way to get a feel for [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).
